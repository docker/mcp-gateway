# Working Sets

Working sets allow you to organize and manage collections of MCP servers as a single unit. Unlike catalogs that serve as repositories of available servers, working sets represent specific configurations of servers you want to use together for different purposes or contexts.

## What are Working Sets?

A working set is a named collection of MCP servers that can be:
- Created and managed independently of catalogs
- Shared across teams via export/import or OCI registries
- Used to quickly switch between different server configurations

Working sets are decoupled from catalogs, meaning the servers in a working set can come from:
- **MCP Registry references**: HTTP(S) URLs pointing to servers in the Model Context Protocol registry
- **OCI image references**: Docker images with the `docker://` prefix

## Enabling Working Sets

Working sets are a feature that must be enabled first:

```bash
# Enable the working-sets feature
docker mcp feature enable working-sets

# Verify it's enabled
docker mcp feature list
```

Once enabled, you'll have access to:
- `docker mcp workingset` commands for managing working sets
- `--working-set` flag for `docker mcp gateway run`
- `-w` or `--working-set` flag for `docker mcp client connect`

## Working Set Commands

### Creating Working Sets

Create a new working set with a name and list of servers:

```bash
# Create a working set with OCI image references
docker mcp workingset create --name dev-tools \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/slack:latest

# Create with MCP Registry references
docker mcp workingset create --name registry-servers \
  --server https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers/71de5a2a-6cfb-4250-a196-f93080ecc860

# Mix MCP Registry and OCI references
docker mcp workingset create --name mixed \
  --server https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers/71de5a2a-6cfb-4250-a196-f93080ecc860 \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest

# Specify a custom ID (otherwise derived from name)
docker mcp workingset create --name "My Servers" --id my-servers \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest
```

**Notes:**
- `--name` is required and serves as the human-readable name
- `--id` is optional; if not provided, it's generated from the name (lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens)
- `--server` can be specified multiple times to add multiple servers
- Server references must be either:
  - `docker://` prefix for OCI images
  - `http://` or `https://` URLs for MCP Registry references

### Listing Working Sets

View all working sets in your system:

```bash
# List all working sets (human-readable format)
docker mcp workingset list

# List with aliases
docker mcp workingset ls

# List in JSON format
docker mcp workingset list --format json

# List in YAML format
docker mcp workingset list --format yaml
```

**Output formats:**
- `human` (default): Tabular format with ID and Name columns
- `json`: Complete JSON representation
- `yaml`: Complete YAML representation

### Showing Working Set Details

Display detailed information about a specific working set:

```bash
# Show a working set (human-readable)
docker mcp workingset show my-working-set

# Show in JSON format
docker mcp workingset show my-working-set --format json

# Show in YAML format
docker mcp workingset show my-working-set --format yaml
```

The output includes:
- Working set ID and name
- List of servers with their types and references
- Configuration for each server
- Secrets configuration
- Tools associated with each server

### Removing Working Sets

Delete a working set from your system:

```bash
# Remove a working set
docker mcp workingset remove my-working-set

# Using alias
docker mcp workingset rm my-working-set
```

**Note:** This only removes the working set definition, not the actual server images or registry entries.

### Exporting Working Sets

Export a working set to a file for backup or sharing:

```bash
# Export to YAML
docker mcp workingset export my-working-set ./my-workingset.yaml

# Export to JSON
docker mcp workingset export my-working-set ./my-workingset.json
```

The file format is automatically detected from the extension (`.yaml` or `.json`).

### Importing Working Sets

Import a working set from a file:

```bash
# Import from YAML
docker mcp workingset import ./my-workingset.yaml

# Import from JSON
docker mcp workingset import ./my-workingset.json
```

**Behavior:**
- If a working set with the same ID doesn't exist, it will be created
- If a working set with the same ID exists, it will be updated
- The file format is automatically detected from the extension

### Pushing Working Sets to OCI Registry

Share working sets via OCI registries:

```bash
# Push to a registry
docker mcp workingset push my-working-set docker.io/myorg/my-workingset:latest

# Push to a private registry
docker mcp workingset push my-working-set registry.example.com/team/workingset:v1.0
```

This allows you to:
- Version control your working sets
- Share with team members
- Deploy consistent configurations across environments

### Pulling Working Sets from OCI Registry

Retrieve working sets from OCI registries:

```bash
# Pull from a registry
docker mcp workingset pull docker.io/myorg/my-workingset:latest

# Pull from a private registry
docker mcp workingset pull registry.example.com/team/workingset:v1.0
```

The working set will be imported into your local system and ready to use.

## Using Working Sets with the Gateway

Once you have working sets configured, you can use them to run the MCP gateway:

```bash
# Run gateway with a specific working set
docker mcp gateway run --working-set my-working-set

# The gateway will start with only the servers defined in that working set
```

**Important restrictions:**
- `--working-set` cannot be used with `--servers` flag
- `--working-set` cannot be used with `--enable-all-servers` flag
- These flags are mutually exclusive to ensure clear server selection

**Current limitations:**
- Working sets currently support image-only servers in the gateway
- Configuration and secrets support is being expanded
- Watch mode and dynamic updates are in development

## Using Working Sets with MCP Clients

Connect an MCP client with a specific working set:

```bash
# Connect client with a working set
docker mcp client connect claude -w my-working-set

# Using long form
docker mcp client connect cursor --working-set my-working-set
```

This generates the appropriate client configuration using the servers from your working set.

## Working Set File Format

Working sets are stored in YAML or JSON with the following structure:

### YAML Format

```yaml
version: 1
id: my-working-set
name: My Working Set
servers:
  - type: image
    image: mcp/github:latest
  - type: registry
    source: https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers/71de5a2a-6cfb-4250-a196-f93080ecc860
    config:
      key: value
    secrets: default
    tools:
      - tool1
      - tool2
secrets:
  default:
    provider: docker-desktop-store
```

### JSON Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "my-working-set",
  "name": "My Working Set",

## Common Workflows

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a development working set
docker mcp workingset create --name dev \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/filesystem:latest

# 2. Test it with the gateway
docker mcp gateway run --working-set dev

# 3. Once satisfied, export for sharing
docker mcp workingset export dev ./dev-workingset.yaml
```

### Team Collaboration

```bash
# Team lead: Create and share
docker mcp workingset create --name team-tools \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/slack:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/jira:latest

docker mcp workingset push team-tools docker.io/myorg/team-tools:v1.0

# Team members: Pull and use
docker mcp workingset pull docker.io/myorg/team-tools:v1.0
docker mcp gateway run --working-set team-tools
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

```bash
# Create different working sets for different environments
docker mcp workingset create --name production \
  --server docker://mcp/monitoring:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/logging:latest

docker mcp workingset create --name staging \
  --server docker://mcp/monitoring:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/logging:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/debug:latest

# Run with appropriate environment
docker mcp gateway run --working-set production  # In production
docker mcp gateway run --working-set staging     # In staging
```

### Project-Based Organization

```bash
# Create working sets per project
docker mcp workingset create --name project-a \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/postgres:latest

docker mcp workingset create --name project-b \
  --server docker://mcp/github:latest \
  --server docker://mcp/mongodb:latest

# Switch between projects easily
docker mcp gateway run --working-set project-a
# ... or ...
docker mcp gateway run --working-set project-b
```

### Versioning Working Sets

```bash
# Create a working set
docker mcp workingset create --name my-tools \
  --server docker://mcp/github:v1.0

# Push version 1.0
docker mcp workingset push my-tools docker.io/myorg/my-tools:1.0

# Update the working set (modify via export/import)
docker mcp workingset export my-tools ./temp.yaml
# ... edit temp.yaml ...
docker mcp workingset import ./temp.yaml

# Push version 1.1
docker mcp workingset push my-tools docker.io/myorg/my-tools:1.1

# Pull specific version when needed
docker mcp workingset pull docker.io/myorg/my-tools:1.0
docker mcp workingset pull docker.io/myorg/my-tools:1.1
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names: `dev-tools`, `production-monitoring`, `team-shared`
- Keep IDs short and memorable: `dev`, `prod`, `team`
- Use versioning in OCI tags: `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `latest`

### Organization Strategies

- **By Environment**: Separate working sets for dev, staging, production
- **By Team**: Different sets for frontend, backend, devops teams
- **By Project**: One working set per major project or application
- **By Use Case**: Sets for debugging, monitoring, development, etc.

### Sharing and Collaboration

- Use OCI registries for team sharing rather than file exports
- Document your working sets in team wikis or READMEs
- Use semantic versioning for working set tags
- Keep a "team-shared" working set for common tools

### Security Considerations

- Working sets use Docker Desktop's secret store by default
- Don't commit exported working sets with sensitive config to version control
- Use private OCI registries for proprietary server configurations
- Review server references before importing from external sources

## Troubleshooting

### Working Set Not Found

```bash
Error: working set my-set not found
```

**Solution**: Check available working sets with `docker mcp workingset list`

### Feature Not Enabled

```bash
Error: unknown command "workingset" for "docker mcp"
```

**Solution**: Enable the feature with `docker mcp feature enable working-sets`

### Invalid Server Reference

```bash
Error: invalid server value: myserver
```

**Solution**: Ensure server references use either:
- `docker://` prefix for images
- `http://` or `https://` for registry URLs

### Conflicting Flags

```bash
Error: cannot use --working-set with --servers flag
```

**Solution**: Choose either `--working-set` or `--servers`, not both

### ID Already Exists

```bash
Error: working set with id my-set already exists
```

**Solution**: Either:
- Choose a different name/ID
- Remove the existing set first with `docker mcp workingset rm my-set`
- Omit the `--id` flag to auto-generate a unique ID

### Export/Import File Format

```bash
Error: unsupported file extension: .txt, must be .yaml or .json
```

**Solution**: Use `.yaml` or `.json` file extensions

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

- Gateway support is limited to image-only servers (no config/secrets yet)
- No automatic watch/reload when working sets are updated
- Limited to Docker Desktop's secret store for secrets
- No built-in conflict resolution for duplicate server names

### Planned Enhancements

- Full config and secrets support in gateway
- Integration with catalog management
- Search and discovery features
